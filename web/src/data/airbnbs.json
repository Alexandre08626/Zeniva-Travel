And it happened because it was designed with the intention of embodying both simplicity and boldness. Unintentionally, Lagöm paved the way for this trend so that today, the Maelström Mountain stands out with a unique and original offer of rental cabins. Perched between sky and earth, at 550 meters above sea level, The Lagöm stands like a beacon calling for balance. From the road, it seems to turn its back on us. But as soon as we climb the few steps leading to the terrace, we realize that it’s to better face one of the most spectacular views that Mother Nature has created. As we get lost in the raw beauty of the mountains and valleys stretching as far as the eye can see, worries evaporate to make way for a state of contemplation. Then we turn around, and finally, The Lagöm shows us its face. Tall and large windows give us a glimpse of a minimalist design bathed in natural light. Once inside, we feel that the space has been designed to nourish the soul and elevate the spirit. On the ground floor, lush plants adorn the space, while a strategically placed mirror in the kitchenette reflects the outdoor view, creating the illusion of a window. Upstairs, the view leaves us speechless, and the bed, as comfortable as a cloud, makes us want to lie down on our backs. The Lagöm’s little extras: • Its thermal tub that allows the body to bathe in well-being while the eyes bathe in the beauty of the scenery. • Its terrace at tree canopy level that gives the impression of being on top of the world. • Its energy certification: 100% operational on solar energy, The Lagöm is eco energy certified. • While staying at The Lagöm, make sure to do more than just appreciate the scenery. Dive into it by venturing onto the nearby trails. Whether you prefer leisurely strolls (such as hiking, snowshoeing, or cross-country skiing) or crave excitement (like mountain biking or fat biking), there’s an adventure waiting that perfectly suits your preferences and level of thrill.

Once these are used up, guests are kindly asked to restock them. \n\n \n\n*QUIET HOURS: To ensure a restful stay, we have quiet hours from 11:00 PM to 8:00 AM.

    "description": "Property Description\n\nWelcome to The Palms, where tranquility meets Caribbean charm. Our rare gem offers three bedrooms, three bathrooms, a fully equipped kitchen, designated workspace, complimentary WIFI, 90 inch TV and free parking. Enjoy outdoor grilling and a sparkling heated pool, all enveloped in a captivating pool-front porch. Guests often find it hard to leave some even dubbing it the best Airbnb experience they've had. This home books fast so please don't wait to book. Children of all ages are welcome.\n\n\n\n\nCalendar is up to date. Rates displayed are our best rates. City regulations prohibit parties on any vacation rental (parties are illegal). Because of problems with parties, we do not rent to local residents. Minimum age to book is 25 years old.\n\n\n\n\nThe space\n\nExplore three cozy bedrooms and three private bathrooms. Relax in the living room adorned with a luxurious sofa and a grand 90-inch TV. Step into the outdoor haven featuring mosquito repellent, a comfortable sitting area, a hammock, pool chairs, and four lounge chairs. Experience ultimate privacy within the fully fenced property.\n\n\n\n\nFrom Nov 15th to May 30th, the pool is set to a cozy 80F, adjustable to 85F for $25 per day. We offer a starter pack of essentials, and guests are responsible for additional supplies.\n\n\n\n\nGuest access\n\nUpon acknowledging our house rules, including a strict NO PARTIES policy and maintaining quiet after 9:00 pm, remote access will be granted.\n\n\n\n\nMaximize your parking with a limit of 3 cars, absolutely NO on-street parking allowed.\n\n\n\n\nOther things to note\n\nFeel free to enjoy the home, but let's keep it neighborly—no parties or unregistered guests. Keep it hushed between 9:00pm - 7:00am. If kids are in tow, safety first! Pool and yard maintenance happen regularly, and garbage day is Tuesday—blue and green out the night before and Friday-blue out the night before.We spruce up before and after your stay, but extra cleaning is $100. Swim with care!\n\n\n\n\nThis is a NON-SMOKING/NO-VAPING home. If smoking outside the home, please make sure you have closed all windows and doors, so smoke doesn't drift inside the home. Ask your host for checkout instructions (spoiler alert: we take care of everything because you are on vacation).\n\n\n\n\nImportant: We are committed to protecting our properties which is why we've partnered with Know Your Guest, the leading vacation rental guest-screening provider. Please note that before your booking begins, you will need to verify your details and ID through Know Your Guest.\n\n\n\n\nRelax, rejuvenate and recharge. You will not want to leave and will certainly want to come back.\n\nContact Agent\n\nAlexandre Blais\n\n581-748-7436\nInfo@zenivatravel.com\n\nBook Now\n\n\n\n\nProperty Details\n\nProperty Type\n\nHouse\n\nBedrooms\n\n3\n\nBathrooms\n\n3\n\nProperty Location\n\n4591 NE 3rd Ave, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33334, États-Unis",

    "description": "Property Description\n\nSOUS-BOIS WITH HOT TUB & PETFRIENDLY Do you know many places where pleasure and relaxation come together? Le Sous-Bois cabin can proudly claim to be one of those places. As soon as you cross the threshold, you are engulfed in well-being. The white paneling of the walls invites us to inhale and exhale deeply to release tension and leave it where it belongs: outside the four walls of this haven of peace. Then, our gaze is drawn to the top of the stairs, where a living space flooded with light awaits, thanks to the three almost entirely glazed facades. Upon ascending the stairs, we realize that all elements of the decor are coordinated. The large caramel leather sectional harmonizes with the stools at the island, where 6 people can comfortably sit, and the wood veneer of the kitchen cabinets. • We love the retro microwave and toaster that add a stylish and nostalgic touch to the overall decor. • We “kif” (as the French say) the projector that unfolds in front of the large window wall, allowing for movie nights with nature as the backdrop. • Above all, we adore the hot tub on the ground floor terrace, which, thanks to the surrounding trees, allows for relaxation in complete privacy. Mountain bike or fat bike enthusiasts particularly appreciate the secure bike storage and convenient access to several nearby trails. Not to mention the outdoor fireplace area and the indoor gas fireplace that are conducive to creating festive or cozy moments. At le Sous-Bois cabin, there’s everything to be happy about.

The master bedroom features a king-size bed, while the second bedroom has a queen-size bed. A queen-size sofa bed is also available in the living room. Enjoy 2 full bathrooms, a smart TV in the living room, and in-unit washer and dryer. The fully equipped kitchen is ideal for preparing your meals, whether you’re staying in to relax or cooking up a feast. Both bedrooms and the living room have sheer and blackout blinds for your comfort. \n\nThis apartment is a haven for nature lovers, with the soothing sounds of birds and stunning sunsets setting the perfect ambiance for relaxation. Just meters away from the island's main spot to view the magical bioluminescence phenomenon at night, you can even enjoy it right from the beach in front, especially during the new moon. \n\nTraveling with a larger group? Let us know, and we’ll share details on additional sister apartments in the same building! We can accommodate a group up to 30 people. \n\n*The building does not have an elevator; stairs must be used for access. \n\nGuest access \n\nYou’ll have access to the shared common area and pool, perfect for relaxing and enjoying the sun. \n\nPool Hours: 8:00 AM - 10:00 PM \n\nOther things to note \n\n*ABOUT HOLBOX: Holbox Island is a true rustic paradise, where nature remains the star. The island’s sandy streets and unspoiled beaches are carefully preserved to maintain their natural beauty. Unlike other destinations that clear sargassum or restrict beach access, Holbox embraces its wild side, offering open and public shores for all to enjoy. \n\nThe island’s character shifts with the seasons. During the rainy season, puddles can form along the sandy roads, adding to its laid-back, rustic charm. \n\nYum Balam’s secluded location away from the lively town center enhances its peaceful atmosphere, though it’s a good idea to plan your transportation in advance to fully enjoy the tranquility. \n\n*WELCOME AMENITIES: We provide essential welcome items such as toilet paper, shampoo, dish soap, and drinking water.

Come create everlasting memories, come enjoy the Nanok’s experience. This name, shrouded in mystery yet evocative, encapsulates the very essence that thrives within this micro cabin. Nanok derives from the initial letters of the owners’ and their children’s names, embodying the unity and family warmth that emanate from this haven of comfort and well-being. At Nanok, life happens outdoors. With two terraces and two patio heaters, everything is in place to stretch out your evenings under the sky, even when the air gets crisp. It’s also the only cabin on the mountain that offers a true hot/cold thermal experience, a real treat for mountain biking enthusiasts (and fans of our bike & sleep formula) looking to unwind after a day riding the region’s best trails. Start with a soak in the hot tub or a good sweat in the sauna, follow it with an invigorating rinse under the cold outdoor shower, and enjoy full-body, mind-clearing relaxation. At Nanok, you’ll love lounging, with only the gentle serenade of the surrounding nature as your soundtrack. Close your eyes and let this symphony lull you, soothe you, transform you.

    "description": "Property Description\n\nCLIFFNO46 Do you know the legend of Cliff? Cliff, a man deeply in love with nature and driven by adventure, roamed the world in search of the perfect place to settle. Despite his relentless searches, he had not yet found it. One day, during an epic expedition on the majestic slopes of Maelström Mountain, Cliff was captivated by golden rays of light shimmering on tree leaves. Drawn by a mystical force, he followed these gleams until he reached the summit of the mountain. There, before him, unfolded a breathtaking spectacle: the vastness of the horizon. With his gaze fixed between sky and earth, Cliff felt a profound certainty: he had found his haven, his refuge in the heart of nature. Is this legend true? No! But does it not exist a little in each of us? That’s why the owners wanted to create a place for the Cliff within us, in search of wonder and the perfect place to pause for a moment.
