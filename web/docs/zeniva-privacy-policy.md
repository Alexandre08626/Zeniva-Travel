## Messaging Platforms
If you contact us via WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger, your messages are processed through Meta Business APIs. We may use automated messaging to acknowledge requests and provide updates. You can request a human agent at any time.

## AI Concierge (Lina AI)
Lina AI provides AI-powered responses to help draft itineraries, answer common questions, and route requests to our concierge team. AI outputs are informational and may require human validation. You can request human review or escalation at any time.

This includes data processing of conversations, message storage for audit and service continuity, and secure access controls. We retain messages only as long as needed for service delivery and compliance.
